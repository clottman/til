From [Chapter 27, Custom Renderers, in Creating Mobile Apps with Xamarin.Forms](https://xamarin.azureedge.net/developer/xamarin-forms-book/XamarinFormsBook-Ch27-Apr2016.pdf) I learned that the way to propagate property changed notifications from a Xamarin Forms control to the custom renderer that renders it, you can overload `OnElementPropertyChanged`. Within that method you can check the property that was changed and make any UI updates you need in the native control. 

From [Chapter 24, Page Navigation](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/creating-mobile-apps-xamarin-forms/) I learned the concrete difference between `Navigation.PushAsync(ContentPage page)` and `Navigation.PushModalAsync(page)`. On platforms without a physical back button, they will be rendered differently. When you use `PushModalAsync`, the view must provide some other way to get 'back' to the previous page.
